# Valentine's Day React Project

## About

This React project is a fun and interactive webpage designed for Valentine's Day. It displays a playful question: "Will you be my Valentine?" accompanied by two response options: a "Yes" button and a "No" button. If the user tries to press "No," the button insists and cleverly avoids being clicked by moving to a new position, encouraging the user to eventually click "Yes." Upon agreeing, the webpage celebrates the acceptance with a heartwarming message and a cute GIF.

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button moves to a new position with every click, while the "Yes" button increases in size, making the interaction playful and engaging.
- **Dynamic Messages**: The "No" button displays different messages, enticing the user to reconsider their choice with whimsical prompts.
- **Visual Feedback**: Before and after clicking "Yes," different GIFs are displayed to visually enrich the user experience.
- **Customizable Appearance**: The project uses CSS for styling, allowing easy customization of the webpage's appearance.
